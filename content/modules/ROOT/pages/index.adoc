== Validate the SQL Environment

____
*Note:* For this scenario, we have started installing SQL Server in the
background. The background task will take between 2-5 minutes to
complete.
____

We have setup two terminal windows running on the local machine - The
current terminal will be used for SQL Server and OS specific commands.
The _cpudist_ terminal will be used for performance tracking using the
cpudist bcc-tool explained later.

To check if ansible installation is complete, we can use the following
command -

....
systemctl status mssql-server.service --no-pager
....

<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>

Active: active (running) since Monday 2019-07-15 19:24:18 EDT; 3h 59min
left

<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>

....

Verify that the Active status is __active (running)__.

Finally, verify that you can connect to SQL Server
....

/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P Redhat1! -Q "`select
@@version`"

....

By the above output, we have confirmed that we can connect to SQL
